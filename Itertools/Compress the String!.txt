Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/compress-the-string/problem

Solution:

from itertools import groupby
groups = []
uniquekeys = []
counter = []
for k, g in groupby(input()):
    groups.append(list(g))    # Store group iterator as a list
    uniquekeys.append(int(k))
for i in groups:
    count = 0
    for j in i:
        count += 1
    counter.append(count)
print(*list(zip(counter, uniquekeys)))
